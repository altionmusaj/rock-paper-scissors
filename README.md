# Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python. You, the player, play against the computer, which randomly selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The program then determines the winner based on the choices made.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter your choice: 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors.
3. The script will display your choice and the computer's choice, then announce the result (win, lose, or draw).
